# Applying_filters

This project is mainly aimed towards people with interest in signal processing.  There is a website where one can upload soundclips and be able to play the content of the files. Different filters to these soundclips could be applied and heard for the changes in the sounds. A typical example could be passing a sound wave through a filter and making changes to the frequency, etc.
